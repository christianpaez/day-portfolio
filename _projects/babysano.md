challenges:
  - text: "Current centralized social media platforms create several key challenges for users and creators."
  - text: "These platforms often use user data for targeted advertising, undermining privacy. Their algorithms prioritize content that reinforces existing beliefs, creating filter bubbles and polarizing communities."
  - text: "Monetization options for creators are limited as most platforms take a large share of revenue and control visibility through unpredictable algorithms."
  - text: "Finally, users lack true ownership of their communities, as platforms maintain control over data, rules, and access, leaving little room for community-led governance."
  - text: "These issues highlight the need for more transparent, user-controlled alternatives."
solutions:
  - text: 'Babysano ("Healthy baby" in Spanish) was created as an all-in-one-platform available as both an app and a website. Designed to give parents or soon to be parents easy access to a wide range of services and products. It also provides a space for doctors to promote their services and connect with families.'
  - text: "The product was designed in Spanish to meet the needs of the local audience in Latin America."
user_personas:
  - text: "Research methods such as interviews, surveys, and studies lead to our development of user personas."

{% include project_text_block.html title="Learnings" description="Understanding Parent Needs: Parents want a single platform that simplifies their daily challenges, combining product purchases, medical advice, community support, and appointments into one seamless experience.

The Power of Community: Parents value a supportive space where they can connect, share experiences, and exchange advice. Fostering this community aspect became a key feature of the platform.

Localization Matters: Designing Babysano in Spanish for the Latin American market emphasized the importance of catering to cultural and language preferences to ensure a more relevant user experience.

Flexibility in Design: The platform needed to accommodate both parents and healthcare professionals, requiring a flexible design that met the distinct needs of each user group while still sharing common goals.

The Need for Integration: Unlike competitors offering isolated services, Babysano's all-in-one approach—combining multiple functionalities —provided a more comprehensive and valuable solution for users.

Access to Health Resources: Offering both virtual and in-person consultations highlighted the importance of telemedicine in providing convenient, stress-reducing access to medical advice for parents.

Continuous Testing and Feedback: Regular user testing and feedback from a selected amount of parents and doctors were essential for refining the platform’s usability and ensuring it met user needs on the way." padding_bottom="4" %}
