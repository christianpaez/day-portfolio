challenges:
  - text: "The process of allowing visitors to enter buildings can often take a significant amount of time, as it typically involves multiple steps, such as verifying the identity of the visitor, contacting the resident for approval, and ensuring proper access procedures are followed."
  - text: "Naturally, this process can lead to delays, and in some cases, there may be challenges in maintaining clear communication between residents and security guards."
  - text: "These communication breakdowns can create confusion, frustration, or even security risks, particularly when visitors are not properly registered or when there is a lack of real- time updates on visitor status."
  - text: "Effective coordination between all parties involved is essential to streamline the entry process and ensure that it runs smoothly and securely."
solutions:
  - text: "• Fastpass Service: The Fastpass feature allows any visitor who presents an approved Fastpass by the resident to gain quick and seamless access to the building or apartment. This eliminates the need for the resident to respond to phone calls from the security guard notifying them of a visitor’s arrival, streamlining the process and making entry faster and more efficient. With Fastpass, the visitor can simply enter without delays, improving convenience for both residents and their guests."
  - text: "• Frequent Access Functionality: Allows residents to pre-register visitors who come regularly, such as household employees, maintenance workers, or caregivers. By registering these visitors in advance, the system ensures smoother access without requiring repeated approval each time they visit. This functionality saves time, enhances security, and provides a more organized entry system for residents and their frequent visitors."

{% include project_text_block.html title="Wireframe process" description="In my UX design process, I used low-fi wireframes as an essential step to quickly explore and refine design ideas. By creating simple sketches early on, I was able to focus on the layout, user flow, and core functionality without getting distracted by aesthetics.

This allowed me to iterate rapidly, test different solutions, and gather valuable feedback from stakeholders. The sketches served as a clear, cost-effective way to communicate my ideas, align the team, and ensure the design was intuitive and user-centered. Ultimately, this approach helped me identify key usability improvements early, streamlining the design process and saving time before moving on to high-fidelity prototypes." padding_bottom="4" %}

This could be an employee, trainer, family member, or anyone who frequently accesses the property.

The goal is to streamline the daily process. The resident will be asked to register the days the visitor will enter, the time range for entry, and an optional expiration for access, if applicable. Additionally, the resident can choose whether they want to receive notifications of the visitor’s entry.

{% include project_text_block.html title="Learnings" description="• Simplifying User Flows for Efficiency: Designing both Frequent Access and Fast Pass features taught me the importance of streamlining user flows to save time while maintaining security. By allowing residents to pre-register visitors or generate Fastpass links, I learned how these systems can minimize delays and reduce the manual work for both residents and security guards.

• Balancing Convenience with Security: For Fast Pass, providing quick access via a QR code helped speed up entry, but it was important to ensure that security measures (like identity verification) were not sacrificed. I learned how to balance the need for fast, convenient entry with the necessity of maintaining a high level of security.

• Empowering Residents with Control: The Frequent Access feature emphasized the value of giving residents more control over their visitors' entry times and notifications. Allowing them to set time ranges, expiration dates, and decide whether to receive notifications added flexibility and improved the overall experience by making the system more adaptable to individual needs." %}
