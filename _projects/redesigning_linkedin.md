{% include project_text_block.html title="The process" padding_bottom="8" background="white" description="To gather feedback on Linkedin's web experience, I conducted a survey to understand pain points and satisfaction levels.

I shared the survey with my LinkedIn network, inviting users to provide open-ended feedback and close-ended responses.

After distributing the survey to my connections, I received responses from 20 users.

This provided me with valuable insights and allowed me to identify areas for potential improvement in Linkedin's interface." %}

{% include project_text_block.html title="Defining the goal" padding_bottom="1" description="• Focus on highlighting key features that are most important and frequently used by users, ensuring they are easily accessible at all times.

• Streamline the user interface to create a clean, visually appealing layout that feels light on the eyes and avoids overwhelming users with unnecessary elements.

• Refine the color scheme to align with LinkedIn’s branding, using a balance of calm, neutral tones with subtle, strategic accent colors to guide user attention and enhance readability.

• Organize content clearly with well-defined categories and intuitive navigation, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for and feel confident in where to go next.

• Enhance the overall look and feel of the platform, focusing on creating an enjoyable, seamless experience that encourages users to stay, explore, and engage with the community." %}
{% include project_text_block.html title="Before/Feed" padding_bottom="1" description="The navigation experience in the feed section has been streamlined. Currently, there are too many buttons, which can overwhelm users and create a cluttered, visually heavy interface. The new design simplifies the layout, reducing visual noise while ensuring that key actions remain prominent and easily accessible. This makes the interface more intuitive, so users can quickly understand what to do without feeling overwhelmed." %}

{% include project_text_block.html title="Search for people, companies and groups" padding_bottom="1" description="In the current design, recent searches are displayed, but the search function lacks clear category organization. The redesigned interface aims to provide a more organized and intuitive search experience by categorizing results into clear sections such as people, companies, and groups making it easier for users to find what they're looking for at a glance." %}
{% include project_image.html name="redesigning-linkedin" extension="png" index="4" alt="LinkedIn image" class="rounded-lg" %}
{% include project_text_block.html title="Network" padding_bottom="1" description="The network section still offers the same functionalities, but the redesign offers way less weight to the eye." %}
{% include project_image.html name="redesigning-linkedin" extension="png" index="5" alt="LinkedIn image" class="rounded-lg" %}
{% include project_text_block.html title="Jobs" padding_bottom="1" description="In the current LinkedIn design, some options on the left- hand sidebar are not yet available. For the redesign of the Jobs section, we've identified a more prominent placement for \"Recent Job Searches\" and repositioned the \"Post a Job\" button to a more visible and accessible location, addressing its current placement lower on the page, which diminishes its visibility and importance." %}
{% include project_image.html name="redesigning-linkedin" extension="png" index="6" alt="LinkedIn image" class="rounded-lg" %}
{% include project_text_block.html title="Profile" padding_bottom="1" description="In the redesigned profile section, the interface has been streamlined by organizing key information into clear categories. In the current LinkedIn design, users with detailed profiles often have to scroll extensively to find relevant sections. To improve this, we've divided the profile into distinct categories such as: About, Activity, Interests, and Awards. This makes it easier for users to navigate and access the information they need." %}

If LinkedIn were to adopt this design in the future, users would likely embrace it for its simplicity, improved navigation, and enhanced user experience." %}
