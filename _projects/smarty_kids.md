challenges:
  - text: "Parents often have a hard time finding an educational app that covers a wide range of topics and is available in multiple languages. Many apps focus on just one subject, which limits a child’s learning. Also, often times parents often struggle to find a way to track their child’s progress, making it hard to see how they are growing and developing."
solutions:
  - text: "Smarty kids addresses this problem by providing a multilingual all in one educational platform that covers a wide array of subjects—from learning the alphabet, colors, and shapes to understanding animals, fruits, and basic vocabulary. The app's interactive activities, such as drawing and games, encourage creativity and cognitive development."
  - text: "On the parents side, Smarty Kids offers a dashboard where parents can easily access subscription plans, monitor their child’s progress, and view a personalized development scale. This feature gives parents a clear understanding of their child’s learning journey, allowing them to track progress and identify areas for improvement, ensuring a comprehensive, customizable, and engaging learning experience."
